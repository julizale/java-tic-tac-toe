# Tic Tac Toe

The popular game of noughts and crosses. 

âš¡
The application offers possibility to play against the computer performing random moves.
You can play in console by running TicTacToeConsoleRunner or using the TicTacToeGUIRunner created with JavaFX. 
You can play up to several rounds, and there's choice between board 3x3 or 10x10. The GUI version allows you to save game to a file.
Since this is my first "big" project, as you can easily guess, the code quality could be much better.
It's waiting for some free time to refactor.

âš¡
To run application, you need to clone repository & build with gradle. Have fun ðŸ‘‹
