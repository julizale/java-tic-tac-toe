# Tic Tac Toe

The popular game of noughts and crosses.

The application gives you the opportunity to play with the computer performing random moves.
You can play in console by running TicTacToeConsoleRunner or using the TicTacToeGUIRunner created with JavaFX. 
You can play up to several rounds, the GUI version allows you to save game to a file.
Since this is my first "big" project, as you can easily guess, the code quality could be much better.
It's waiting for some free time to refactor.
